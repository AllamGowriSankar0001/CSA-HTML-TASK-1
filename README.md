## HTML Multi-Page Website

A simple four-page HTML-only site built to practice core tags and semantic structure. Live preview: https://allamgowrisankar0001.github.io/CSA-HTML-TASK-1/

### Folder Structure
- `index.html` — Home
- `about.html` — About
- `service.html` — Services
- `contact.html` — Contact
- `image/` — project images
- `audio/` — audio sample and supporting files
- `video/` — video sample
- `styles/` — page-specific CSS (not required by the task but included here)

### Page Highlights
- **Home (`index.html`)**: Navigation links, headings (`h1`–`h3`), paragraphs with `strong`, `em`, `mark`, line break and horizontal rule, image, footer with copyright.
- **About (`about.html`)**: Headings and paragraphs using `b`, `i`, `u`, `sup`, `sub`, `small`; ordered, unordered, and description lists; `div` and `span` usage.
- **Services (`service.html`)**: Table with `caption`, `thead`, `tbody`; semantic `article` and `aside`; embedded media (`video`, `audio`, `iframe`).
- **Contact (`contact.html`)**: Form with `fieldset` and `legend`; inputs for text, email, password, number, date, radio, checkbox, file; `textarea`, `select`, `option`, and submit `button`, with `required` and `placeholder` attributes.

### Navigation
- Consistent `<nav>` in every page linking to all four HTML files via relative paths.
- Assets referenced locally from `image/`, `audio/`, and `video/`.

### Running Locally
1) Open the folder in any browser.  
2) Start at `index.html` and use the nav links to move between pages. No build steps or dependencies.

### Notes
- Task constraints were HTML-only; CSS files are present but can be removed if strict no-CSS is required.
